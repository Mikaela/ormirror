# Somewhat curated Onion Service list

This repository began as a manual copy of mikaela.github.io/or/ with less
git history for use with cloning on TAILS and similar for offline reference
although it's also available through the aforementioned address as a
submodule.

The onions in this repository aren't meant to be clickable, but
copy-pasteable.
